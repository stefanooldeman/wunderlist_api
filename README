# A wunderlist todo webservice

# Requires:
- ruby-2.2.2
- mongodb (just install, no setup required)
- bundler

# Notes
For now only tasks can be listed, added and deleted. No authorization, users or lists of tassk. etc.

# Further whishes

*Should haves*
- support for time tracking (updating a tasks time tracking properties with PUT)
- POST tasks/:id/archive, a custom verb because DELETE is taken (and I believe so far; webmachine only responds with 200 or 204).
  when someone' archiving a task, I want to respond with 303 status code and give the link to the archive list.
- GET /lists/:list/tasks I want to reuse the TasksRepresenter under a different webmachine resource, and see how this plays out.

*Could have*
- Multiple API urls, to experiment with curies and the use of multiple host endpoints.
  An idea would be to connect a different public API and integrate this into the responses. (Kick ass!)
  private api's would be a bit difficult; because I want clients to only use 1 authorization method I would have to proxy that endpoint.

*Nice to have*
- auth. I want to play a bit with oauth2 and see what Grant Type can be used to simplify api usage.
  this would also require useres and the use of CanCan to support private tasks and lists.
